# when to use glDrawArrays and glDrawElements?
glDrawArrays well just draw an array of vertex points, Where glDrawElements Will draw the vertex points from an array that also has an index array bound to it
glDrawElements can save on how many vertex points you need to send to the GPU
 they even have a better option too, at lest for a particle system. The 
glDrawElementsInstanced(GL_TRIANGLES, 6, GL_UNSIGNED_INT, 0, m_size);
 this lets you define the object once and draw it m_size times. Little harder to setup tho but pretty cool for drawing thousands of objects in 1 draw call.
